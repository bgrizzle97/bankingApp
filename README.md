# High-Security Banking Application

A production-ready, full-stack banking application built with security-first principles, following the Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

## Project Overview

This application is designed to meet the most stringent security standards of the financial industry, implementing:

- **Security by Design**: Proactive security integration into core architecture
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access permissions
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Verify everything before granting access
- **Secure Supply Chain**: Scrutinized third-party components

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React SPA with secure UI components
- **Backend**: .NET microservices with OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with encryption at rest and in transit
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes orchestration with Docker containers
- **Security**: Multi-factor authentication, RBAC, comprehensive logging
