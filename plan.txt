Phased Development Plan for a Secure Banking Application
This document outlines a phased development plan for a coding agent, based on the "High-Security Banking Application: Development Plan." Each phase has specific goals, tasks, and deliverables to ensure a structured, secure, and efficient development process.

Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (Duration: 3 Months)
Goal: Establish the project's foundational infrastructure, security baseline, and core backend services. This phase is critical for setting up a secure and automated environment before feature development begins.

Tasks for Coding Agent:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

Write Terraform or CloudFormation scripts to provision all necessary cloud infrastructure (VPC, subnets, security groups, IAM roles).

Ensure all infrastructure configurations adhere to the principle of least privilege.

CI/CD Pipeline Setup:

Initialize a Git repository with protected branches and mandatory code review policies.

Build a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) with stages for:

Building the .NET application.

Running unit tests.

Scanning for vulnerabilities with integrated SAST and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools.

Building and pushing a secure Docker image to a private registry.

Containerization & Orchestration:

Create a hardened Dockerfile for the .NET backend, using a minimal, secure base image.

Write Kubernetes manifest files (or Helm charts) for deploying the application.

Deploy a development-grade Kubernetes cluster.

Core Backend Services:

Develop the initial microservices for User Authentication and Account Management using .NET.

Implement authentication endpoints using OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 protocols.

Design and create the initial database schema for core user and account tables in PostgreSQL or MS SQL.

Initial Security Measures:

Conduct a preliminary threat model of the core architecture.

Implement a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS/Azure Key Vault) and integrate it with the CI/CD pipeline and Kubernetes.

Deliverables:

A fully automated, functional CI/CD pipeline.

A running development Kubernetes cluster.

Deployed core authentication and user management microservices.

Documented infrastructure setup and initial threat model.

Phase 2: Feature Development & Frontend Scaffolding (Duration: 3 Months)
Goal: Build out the core banking features in the backend and establish the foundation for the frontend application.

Tasks for Coding Agent:

Backend Feature Expansion:

Develop microservices for key features: Funds Transfer, Transaction History, and Bill Pay.

Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all new services.

Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to secure all API endpoints.

Frontend Foundation:

Set up a new frontend project using React or Angular.

Develop a design system with a library of reusable, secure UI components.

Build the main application layout, navigation, and routing.

Implement the user login, registration, and logout flows, connecting them to the backend authentication service.

Database Expansion:

Extend the database schema to support the new features.

Implement column-level encryption for highly sensitive data fields (e.g., account numbers).

Security Enhancement:

Update the threat model to include the new features and frontend application.

Integrate Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools into the testing process.

Deliverables:

Functional and tested microservices for all core banking features.

A running frontend application with user authentication and a basic component library.

An expanded and more secure database schema.

Initial SAST and DAST scan reports for the new components.

Phase 3: Integration, Testing & Hardening (Duration: 3 Months)
Goal: Integrate all application components, conduct comprehensive security and performance testing, and harden the entire system for production readiness.

Tasks for Coding Agent:

Full-Stack Integration:

Connect the frontend application to all backend microservices, ensuring all features are fully functional from the UI.

Implement end-to-end data flows for all user workflows.

Comprehensive Testing:

Write and execute automated end-to-end tests for all critical user journeys.

Perform load and performance testing to ensure the application can handle expected user traffic.

Security Hardening:

Coordinate with a third-party vendor for a full penetration test.

Remediate all identified vulnerabilities from SAST, DAST, and penetration testing reports.

Implement strict network policies in Kubernetes to control traffic between pods.

Implement robust logging, monitoring, and alerting across the entire application stack.

Documentation:

Generate and finalize API documentation.

Create and update architecture diagrams and operational runbooks.

Deliverables:

A fully integrated, end-to-end functional application.

Comprehensive test reports (performance, load, end-to-end).

A penetration test report with a corresponding remediation plan.

A hardened, production-ready environment.

Complete technical documentation.

Phase 4: Deployment & Go-Live (Duration: 1 Month)
Goal: Deploy the application to the production environment and make it available to end-users.

Tasks for Coding Agent:

Production Deployment:

Execute the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the application to the production Kubernetes cluster.

Perform final smoke tests and configuration checks in the production environment.

Monitoring & Support:

Configure production monitoring dashboards and set up critical alerts.

Finalize and test the incident response plan.

Go-Live:

Execute the go-live plan to make the application publicly accessible.

Engage in hyper-care monitoring to immediately address any post-launch issues.

Deliverables:

The application successfully running in the production environment.

Active production monitoring dashboards and alerts.

A documented and tested incident response plan.

Phase 5: Maintenance & Iteration (Ongoing)
Goal: Ensure the long-term security and reliability of the application while continuously delivering value through new features.

Tasks for Coding Agent:

Proactive Maintenance:

Continuously monitor security feeds and apply patches for new vulnerabilities.

Regularly update all frameworks, libraries, and base images.

Schedule and execute periodic security audits and penetration tests.

Iterative Development:

Work on new features and improvements based on a product roadmap.

Apply the full Secure SDLC to all new development work, ensuring new code is as secure as the original application.

Deliverables:

Regular security and maintenance reports.

A continuously updated and secure application.

A backlog of new features for future development cycles.
