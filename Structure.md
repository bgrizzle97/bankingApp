## 🛡️ Guiding Principles

Our development approach is guided by these fundamental security principles:

### 🔒 Security by Design
> **Proactively build security into the core architecture and design of the application, rather than treating it as an afterthought.**

### 🏰 Defense in Depth
> **Implement multiple layers of security controls, so that if one control fails, others are in place to protect sensitive data and systems.**

### 🔐 Principle of Least Privilege
> **Users and systems should only have access to the information and resources that are absolutely necessary for their legitimate purposes.**

### 🚫 Zero Trust Architecture
> **Do not automatically trust any user or device, whether inside or outside the network perimeter. Verify everything before granting access.**

### 🔗 Secure the Entire Supply Chain
> **Scrutinize all third-party and open-source components to mitigate the risk of supply chain attacks.**

### 💰 Cryptocurrency Security
> **Implement enterprise-grade security for digital asset management and trading operations.**
