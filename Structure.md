## 🎯 Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for the development of a new, **highly secure banking application**. The primary objective is to create a production-ready, full-stack application that adheres to the most stringent security standards of the financial industry.

### 🎯 Key Objectives

- ✅ **Security-First Design**: Integrate security into every phase of development
- ✅ **Financial Compliance**: Meet PCI DSS, SOX, GLBA, and FFIEC requirements
- ✅ **Zero Trust Architecture**: Verify everything before granting access
- ✅ **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers for comprehensive protection
- ✅ **Continuous Security**: Ongoing monitoring and threat mitigation

> **This is a living document, intended to be updated as the project evolves.**

## 🛡️ Guiding Principles

Our development approach is guided by these fundamental security principles:

### 🔒 Security by Design
> **Proactively build security into the core architecture and design of the application, rather than treating it as an afterthought.**

### 🏰 Defense in Depth
> **Implement multiple layers of security controls, so that if one control fails, others are in place to protect sensitive data and systems.**

### 🔐 Principle of Least Privilege
> **Users and systems should only have access to the information and resources that are absolutely necessary for their legitimate purposes.**

### 🚫 Zero Trust Architecture
> **Do not automatically trust any user or device, whether inside or outside the network perimeter. Verify everything before granting access.**

### 🔗 Secure the Entire Supply Chain
> **Scrutinize all third-party and open-source components to mitigate the risk of supply chain attacks.**

| **Development** | Secure Coding | Adhere to secure coding standards and best practices |
| **Testing** | Security Testing | Implement SAST, DAST, and penetration testing |
| **Deployment** | Secure Pipeline | Utilize a secure CI/CD pipeline with automated security checks |
